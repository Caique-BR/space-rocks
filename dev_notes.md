make a hard/easy mode selector on the main menu(add audio setting too?), that changes the fire mode and health of enemies ships

pick a better sound for the engine, add a particle for ship turning, like the air being release on the side to turn the other way

add a cooldown for the shield to start recharging, it currently begins as soon as damage is taken, add a "bubble" for the sheild(starts cracking when close to braking)

new enemy, more than one at once(difficult mode), new weapon for enemies

fixed levels? as in not just rocks in a loop, maybe a set 10 total levels with a boss at the end

add power-ups:
	v style firing type for the gun
	extra life/fully charge shield
	"omnimovement" for the ship
	missile weapon?
